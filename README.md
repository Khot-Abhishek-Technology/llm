## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

### **1. Test Creation (HR Panel)**

* HR creates tests including **Aptitude** and **DSA** sections.
* Questions are **automatically generated** using the **Gemini API**, with configurable parameters (difficulty, topics, number of questions).
* Student list is uploaded, and unique email links are sent for test access.

### **2. Test Execution (Student Side)**

* Students join via their unique test link.
* Real-time monitoring via **Face-api.js** detects:

  * Multiple faces
  * Browser minimize/tab switch
  * Suspicious movements
* On detecting cheating, an **automated email alert** is sent to HR, and the student‚Äôs status is marked as **Fail**.

### **3. Post-Test Analysis**

* Results are stored with detailed metadata:

  * Time taken per question
  * DSA solution complexity
  * Attempts and accuracy
* Data is **cleaned** and fed into a **GenAI model** to generate:

  * Suggested practice questions
  * Weak topic analysis
* Students receive personalized improvement emails.

### **4. Learning & Interaction**

* **Animation-based DSA learning module** for better understanding of algorithms.
* Integrated **video call system** for direct HR‚Äìstudent communication.
* Automated stage-wise email notifications to both HR and students.
